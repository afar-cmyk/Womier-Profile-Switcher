A simple python script to swap between profiles for the Womier M68 HE v2, 

## Instalation
Extract the `.zip` file and run the software from the Womier `Profile Switcher.exe` file.

## Setup
1. Export your desired profiles from the Womier web-software.
2. Move the exported `.json` files into the `profile` folder (located next to `Profile Switcher.exe`).
3. Run `Profile Switcher.exe` to ensure the profiles are loaded correctly.

## Usage
Once configured, you can switch between your profiles using the shortcut: `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `0`

## Future development
This might be the last version because I had to return this keyboard (Womier M68 HE v2) so I have no way to debug or to add new features without said keyboard.

## Last words
This keyboard is really solid but it's lacking some features in the web-software.
Anyway, I hope some one find it useful because this is the cheapest HE Keyboard in Amazon.
